--><div class="content"><!--introduction--><p>Some times the user may be in need of not only evaluating nestedness and/or modularity in a single bipartite network, but in a set of related networks. There exist many examples in the literature of how these kind of analysis are perfored (i.e. see <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/28/E288.abstract">Flores et al 2011</a> for Phage-bacteria and <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/100/16/9383.full">Bascompte et al 2003</a> for plant-pollinator networks). <tt>BiMat</tt> comes with a couple of classes that the user can use in order to perform this kind of analysis. The name of these classes are <tt>MetaStatistics</tt> and <tt>MetaStatisticsPlotter</tt>. The main functionality of the first one is to take as inputo a entire set of bipartite networks and perform modularity and nested analysis among them. Finally, the second class is used in order to have a better visual understanding of the results.</p><!--/introduction--><h2>Contents</h2><div><ul><li><a href="#1">Example: Seed dispersal networks</a></li></ul></div><h2>Example: Seed dispersal networks<a name="1"></a></h2><p>This example will show how to perform this kind of analysis. In order to do that, we will use seed-dispersal bipartite networks. These networks were collected for Bascompte's lab website <a href="http://www.web-of-life.es/">The Web of Life</a>. We will explain the process of this king of analysis from the point in which the user have already a set of data sets, which in these case correspond to bipartite matrices encoded in text files. The data used in this example can be located inside the <tt>examples/data/</tt> directory.</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">%We will need first to read the data and create all the required matrices.</span>

% <http://www.pnas.org/content/100/16/9383.full Bascompte et al 2003> for
% plant-pollinator networks). 
% |BiMat| comes with a couple of classes that the user can use in order to
% perform this kind of analysis. The name of these classes are
% |MetaStatistics| and |MetaStatisticsPlotter|. The main functionality of
% the first one is to take as inputo a entire set of bipartite networks and

% class is used in order to have a better visual understanding of the
% results.


%% Example: Seed dispersal networks

% The Web of Life>. We will explain the process of this king of analysis
% from the point in which the user have already a set of data sets, which
% in these case correspond to bipartite matrices encoded in text files.
% The data used in this example can be located inside the |examples/data/|
% directory. 
%We will need first to read the data and create all the required matrices.
%This part of the code need to be executed inside examples directory
matrix_files = dir('data/seed_dispersal_matrices/M_SD_*');
n_files = length(matrix_files);
bip_networks = cell(n_files,1);
for i = 1:n_files
    bip_networks{i} = Reader.READ_BIPARTITE_MATRIX(['data/seed_dispersal_matrices/',matrix_files(i).name]);
end

%Now we can create our MetaStatistics instance:
meta_stat = MetaStatistics(bip_networks);
%%
% Once we have the |MetaStatistics| instance, we can configure it to

meta_stat.do_community = false;
meta_stat.do_nestedness = true; %default value
meta_stat.nestedness_algorithm = @NestednessNODF;
meta_stat.replicates = 100;
%%
% After configuring the experiment, we can just launch it by typing:
meta_stat.DoMetaAnalyisis();
%%
% After performing the experiment we can print or plot the results:
%print results
meta_stat.Print;
%%
%The next value will be used for the error bars of the plot
meta_stat.plotter.p_value = 0.05; %Default value
%plot the results
figure(1);meta_stat.plotter.PlotNestednessValues();
%%
% Finally, we can get a better idea of the results by plotting the nested
% matrices.
meta_stat.plotter.back_color = [255 229 204]/255;
meta_stat.plotter.cell_color = [96 96 96]/255;
