</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="use_case_moebus_01.png" alt=""> <h2>Calculating Modularity<a name="5"></a></h2><p>The modularity algorithm is encoded in the property modules of the bipartite object (<tt>bp.modules</tt>). Tree algorithms are available:</p><div><ol><li>Adaptive BRIM (<tt>AdaptiveBrim.m</tt>)</li><li>LP&amp;BRIM (<tt>LPBrim.m</tt>)</li><li>Newman Algorithm (<tt>NewmanAlgorithm.m</tt>)</li></ol></div><p>Adaptive BRIM algorithm is assigned by default during the creation of the Bipartite object. However, we can assign another algorithm dinamically. For example to change to Newman Algorithm:</p><pre class="codeinput">bp.modules = NewmanModularity(bp.matrix);
bp.modules.DoKernighanLinTunning = true; <span class="comment">% This flag is exclusive of the Newman Algorithm.</span>
bp.modules = AdaptiveBrim(bp.matrix); <span class="comment">% Return to the default algorithm</span>
</pre><p>We need to calculate the modularity by calling:</p><pre class="codeinput">bp.modules.Detect();
</pre><p>If we are interested only in node community indexes we can use <tt>bp.modules.row_modules</tt> and <tt>bp.modules.col_modules</tt>. However for modularity values we need to call <tt>bp.modules.Qb</tt> or <tt>bp.modules.Qr</tt> as is: the next lines of code:</p><pre class="codeinput">fprintf(<span class="string">'The modularity value Qb is %f\n'</span>, bp.modules.Qb);
fprintf(<span class="string">'The fraction of interactions inside modules Qr is %f\n'</span>,bp.modules.Qr);
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">The modularity value Qb is 0.785217
The fraction of interactions inside modules Qr is 0.902402
</pre><p>The value 0&lt;=Qb&lt;=1 is calculated using the standard bipartite modularity function (introduced by Barber): <img src="use_case_moebus_eq84355.png" alt="$$Q_b = \frac{1}{m} Trace(R^T (B-P) T)$"></p><p>while the value 0&lt;=Qr&lt;=1 represents the fraction of interactions that fall inside modules: <img src="use_case_moebus_eq58282.png" alt="$$Q_r = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n B_{ij}\delta(g_i,g_j)$"></p><h2>Calculating Nestedness<a name="9"></a></h2><p>Two algorithms exist for calculating nestedness. Contrary to the case of modularity, in this case there is no need to change the algorithm because all the algorithms have an independent property in the Bipartite object. These algorithms are:</p><div><ul><li>NODF (Nestedness metric based on overlap and decreasing filling). With value in the interval [0,1].</li><li>NTC (Nestedness Temperature Calculator) With value in the interval [0 1].</li></ul></div><p>The first algorithm is runned during the creation of the Bipartite object, but because the NTC algorithm is slow, you need to run the algorithm explicitally:</p><pre class="codeinput">bp.ntc.CalculateNestedness();
</pre><p>Finally to show acces the values of the two algorithms you need to call:</p><pre class="codeinput">fprintf(<span class="string">'The nestedness NODF value is %f\n'</span>, bp.nodf.nodf); <span class="comment">%The same value will be printed all the times</span>
fprintf(<span class="string">'The nestedness NTC value is %f\n'</span>, bp.ntc.N); <span class="comment">%Because the value depends in the sorting of rows and columns, it may variate from trial to trial.</span>
</pre><p>We can print all the values of structure values by just calling:</p><pre class="codeinput">bp.printer.PrintStructureValues
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">The nestedness NODF value is 0.034053
The nestedness NTC value is 0.954034

</pre><h2>Plotting in Matrix Layout<a name="12"></a></h2><p>You can print the layout of the original, nestedness and modular sorting. If you matrix is weighted in a categorical way using integers (0,1,2...) you can visualize a different color for each interaction, where 0 is no interaction. For using this functionality you need to assign a color for each interaction and specifically indicate that you want a color for each interaction before calling the plot function:</p><pre class="codeinput">figure(1);

</pre><p>We can also study if a correlation exist between the the row labeling and the module configuration. For performing this analysis we always will need a labaling for rows and/or columns that group them in different sets. In this case we have as labeling the station number from which the bacteria and phages were extracted. Therefore what we will study is if there exist a correlation between the station location (geography) and the module configuration. We will use the same method that was used in Flores et al 2012. Given the labeling this method calculates the diversity index of the labeling inside each module and compare it with random permutations of the labeling across the matrix.</p><pre class="codeinput">bp.internal_statistics.TestDiversityRows(1000); <span class="comment">%Using the labeling of bp and 1000 random permutations</span>

##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% BiMat Use case using Moebus cross-infection matrix data
% This use case will introduce the user to the most basic functionalities
% of the BiMat Software. In order to do that we will calculate some of the
% results presented on the Flores et al 2012 paper (Multi-scale structure
% and geographic drivers of cross-infection within marine bacteria and
% phages). We will show how to perform the next things:
%

%% Add the source to the matlab path
g = genpath('matlab'); addpath(g);
close all;
%%%
% We need also to load the data from which we will be working on
load moebus_use_case.mat;

%% Creating the Bipartite network object
bp = Bipartite(moebus.weight_matrix);    % Create the main object
bp.row_labels = moebus.bacteria_labels;  % Updating node labels
bp.col_labels = moebus.phage_labels;     
bp.row_class = moebus.bacteria_stations;   % Updating node ids
bp.col_class = moebus.phage_stations;
%%%
% We can print the general properties of the network with:
bp.printer.PrintGeneralProperties();
%% Calculating Modularity
% The modularity algorithm is encoded in the property modules of the
% bipartite object (|bp.modules|). Tree algorithms are available:
%
% # Adaptive BRIM (|AdaptiveBrim.m|)
% # LP&BRIM (|LPBrim.m|)
% # Newman Algorithm (|NewmanAlgorithm.m|)
%
% Adaptive BRIM algorithm is assigned by default during the creation of the
% Bipartite object. However, we can assign another algorithm dinamically.
% For example to change to Newman Algorithm:
bp.modules = NewmanModularity(bp.matrix);
bp.modules.DoKernighanLinTunning = true; % This flag is exclusive of the Newman Algorithm.
bp.modules = AdaptiveBrim(bp.matrix); % Return to the default algorithm
%%%
% We need to calculate the modularity by calling:
bp.modules.Detect();
%%
% If we are interested only in node community indexes we can use
% |bp.modules.row_modules| and |bp.modules.col_modules|. However for
% modularity values we need to call |bp.modules.Qb| or |bp.modules.Qr| as
% is:
% the next lines of code:
fprintf('The modularity value Qb is %f\n', bp.modules.Qb);
fprintf('The fraction of interactions inside modules Qr is %f\n',bp.modules.Qr);
%%
% The value 0<=Qb<=1 is calculated using the standard bipartite modularity
% function (introduced by Barber):
% $$Q_b = \frac{1}{m} Trace(R^T (B-P) T)$
%
% while the value 0<=Qr<=1 represents the fraction of interactions that fall
% inside modules:
% $$Q_r = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n B_{ij}\delta(g_i,g_j)$

%% Calculating Nestedness
% Two algorithms exist for calculating nestedness. Contrary to the case
% of modularity, in this case there is no need to change the algorithm
% because all the algorithms have an independent property in the Bipartite
% object. These algorithms are:
%
% * NODF (Nestedness metric based on overlap and decreasing filling). With
% value in the interval [0,1].
% * NTC (Nestedness Temperature Calculator) With value in the interval [0
% 1].
%
% The first algorithm is runned during the creation of the Bipartite
% object, but because the NTC algorithm is slow, you need to run the
% algorithm explicitally:
bp.ntc.CalculateNestedness();
%%
% Finally to show acces the values of the two algorithms you need to call:
fprintf('The nestedness NODF value is %f\n', bp.nodf.nodf); %The same value will be printed all the times
fprintf('The nestedness NTC value is %f\n', bp.ntc.N); %Because the value depends in the sorting of rows and columns, it may variate from trial to trial.
%%%
% We can print all the values of structure values by just calling:
bp.printer.PrintStructureValues
%% Plotting in Matrix Layout
% You can print the layout of the original, nestedness and modular sorting.
% If you matrix is weighted in a categorical way using integers
% (0,1,2...) you can visualize a different color for each
% interaction, where 0 is no interaction. For using this functionality you
% need to assign a color for each interaction and specifically indicate
% that you want a color for each interaction before calling the plot function:
figure(1);
set(gcf,'Position',[19    72   932   922]); % Matlab command to change the figure window;
bp.plotter.FontSize = 2.5; %Change the font size of the rows and labels
bp.plotter.use_type_interaction = true; % I want to use different color for each kind of interaction
bp.plotter.color_interactions(1,:) = [1 0 0]; %Red color for clear lysis
bp.plotter.color_interactions(2,:) = [0 0 1]; %Blue color for turbid spots
bp.plotter.back_color = 'white';
bp.plotter.PlotMatrix(); %After changing all the format we finally can call the plotting function.
%%
% For plotting the nestedness matrix you may decide to use or not an
% iscoline. The nestedness pattern is just the matrix sorted in decreasing
% degree for row and column nodes.
figure(2);
set(gcf,'Position',[19+200    72   932   922]); % Matlab command to change the figure window;
bp.plotter.use_isocline = true; % The isocline is used in the NTC algorithm.
bp.plotter.isocline_color = 'red'; %Decide the color of the isocline.
bp.plotter.PlotNestedMatrix();
%%
% For plotting the modularity sort, the plot function will calculate the
% modularity (call |bp.modules.Detect()|) if you have not previouslly call
% it. 
figure(3);
set(gcf,'Position',[19+400    72   932   922]); % Matlab command to change the figure window;
bp.plotter.plot_iso_modules = true; %This will plot isoclines inside modules.
bp.plotter.PlotModularMatrix();

%% Statistical analysis in the entire network
% We can perform an statistical analysis in the entire network for
% nestedness and modularity. In order to make an statistical analysis of
% the structure values we need to decide how many replicates we will need
% and what null model is more convenient for what we need. File
% |NullModels.m| contain all the availaible null models, while file
% |StatisticalTest.m| contains all the functions required for performing this
% analysis. We can perfom the analysis in all the structure values by the
% use of a single function call the required functions for nestedness and
% modularity analysis:
bp.statistics.print_output = 0; % Do not show outputs
bp.statistics.DoCompleteAnalysis(10, @NullModels.EQUIPROBABLE); %Bernoulli
bp.statistics.DoCompleteAnalysis(10, @NullModels.AVERAGE); %Probability degree
bp.printer.PrintStructureStatistics(); %Print the statistical values
%%
% All structure statistics calculate the next numbers:
%
% # value: Structure value of the tested bipartite network
% # p: p-value of a t-test
% # ci: Confidence interval of the mean of the random bipartite networks
% using a t-test
% # percent: Ratio of how many random matrices have an structure value
% smallen than the tested network
% # z-score: Z-score of the value in the tested network using the values of
% the random networks. Be careful when using this value because the random
% distribution may not be normal.
% # replicates: The quantity of random networks used in the analysis.
%
%% Statistical Analysis of the internal modules
% In addition to be able to perform structure analysis in the entire
% network, we may be able (depending in the size and module configuration
% of the tested matrix) to perform structure analysis in the internal
% modules. We will show next (i) how to do an analysis of modularity and
% nestedness in the internal modules and (ii) how to test for a possible
% correlation between node labeling and module configuration.
% All the functions for performing this kind of analysis is encoded in file
% |InternalStatistics.m|. For calculating the the statistical structure of the
% internal modules we just need to call:
bp.internal_statistics.TestInternalModules(20,@NullModels.EQUIPROBABLE); %100 replicates and Bernoulli as null model
bp.printer.PrintStructureStatisticsOfModules(); % Print the results
%%
% We can also study if a correlation exist between the the row labeling and
% the module configuration. For performing this analysis we always will
% need a labaling for rows and/or columns that group them in different
% sets. In this case we have as labeling the station number from which the
% bacteria and phages were extracted. Therefore what we will study is if
% there exist a correlation between the station location (geography) and
% the module configuration. We will use the same method that was used in
% Flores et al 2012. Given the labeling this method calculates the
% diversity index of the labeling inside each module and compare it with
% random permutations of the labeling across the matrix.
bp.internal_statistics.TestDiversityRows(1000); %Using the labeling of bp and 1000 random permutations
bp.internal_statistics.TestDiversityColumns(1000,moebus.phage_stations,@Diversity.SHANNON_INDEX); % Using specific labeling and Shannon index
bp.printer.PrintColumnModuleDiversity(); %Print the information of column diversity
